## About
Versatile moderation bot utilising modern Pythonic Discord API (PyPi v1.7.2) with many utilities, and a few fun modules for an invite-only global community language server that I administer. Charity uses a self-hosted MongoDB database on the backend for a few flexible user-data modules and is entirely written in Python.

## Development
This project is in its beta phasea and will forever remain in its beta phase. The server configurator is failing my UX expectations and a few auto-moderator and moderator features will remain disabled.
